# rat_scg_scRNA
This repository contains an R markdown file used to analyze scRNA-Seq data of cells sourced from embryonic rat superior cervical ganglia and exposed to three treatment conditions. 10x run data was processed with cellranger on NYULH's Big Purple HPC facility to create count matrices which are analyzed with the code in this repository.
